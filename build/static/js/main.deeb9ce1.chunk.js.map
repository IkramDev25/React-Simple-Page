average\n              gym goer to get a little thicker around the middle? Well, there are a few things.\n              <br/>\n              <br/>\n              1. Calories: Most fitness enthusiasts—even the one who are really into it—don't spend hours at the gym \n              training a body part. They have limited time to work out, and as a result, they simply aren't expending the \n              same amount of energy as a bodybuilder. Six meals a day can add up quickly. If you aren't perfectly\n              portioning out every meal, you could easily go over your maintenance or fat-loss totals and find yourself\n              in a surplus. \n              <br/>\n              </div>\n              <img src = {foodImage1} />\n              </div>\n              2. Meal frequency: Somewhere along the line it became established that eating frequently (as in every two hours or so) would rev up\n              your metabolism, like stoking a fire. But scientific evidence doesn't necessarily support this. “Meal frequency does not boost metabolism,\n              ”Roussell said. In fact, too much protein intake can cause your body to build up a tolerance. That means  you won't effectively utilize dietary\n              protein as opposed to if you spaced out your meals more. Roussell suggests waiting at least two hours to eat after a liquid protein, like BCAAs\n              or a shake, or four hours after a solid meal.\n              <br/>\n              <br/>\n              <div className=\"rightImage\" >\n              <div>\n              3. Carbohydrates: No, they aren't the devil, but if you want to get shredded, intake needs to be \n              monitored. Again, these massive dudes are using up a ton of energy, and their  carbohydrate intake \n              requirements will be higher than the average lifter. Roussell suggests  keeping your starchiest carbs\n              contained to your post-workout meal or in the morning. And if you aren’t satisfied with the results,\n              eliminate the starchy carbs from breakfast.\n              <br/>\n              <br/>\n             \n              </div>\n              <img src = {foodImage2} />\n\n              </div>\n              4. Longevity: Do you want to eat chicken breasts and broccoli forever? Even bodybuilders\n              cycle their diet, eating more calories during the off season to pack on muscle, and then\n              changing their diet to shed pounds of body fat for competitions. It's a tough lifestyle that  requires a lot of commitment, and most of us are \n              more interested in staying reasonably lean year round instead of swinging between gaining and losing weight. Plain and simple, bodybuilders\n              ultimately have different goals, and their lives revolve around getting up on  stage at sub-10 percent body fat.\n              <br/>\n              <br/>\n              But there definitely are \n              takeaways from a bodybuilding diet that can help the average person build muscle and burn excess body fat.\n              <br/>\n              <br/>\n              1. Protein: Most of us don’t eat enough of it. But if you want to feel satisfied after a meal and have the proper nutrients to build muscle, you \n              want to consume at least 30g per meal. This number will trigger your body’s ability to optimally synthesize protein, and is the minimum amount \n              needed to for a satiety response. In other words, you are more likely to be satisfied eating four meals with 30g minimum of protein, than 6 to 8\n              meals with less protein.\n              <br/>\n              <br/>\n\n              2. Planning: Bodybuilders plan out their meals, leaving nothing to chance. Whether it be meal prep for the week, or keeping protein powder at t\n              he office so you aren’t stuck trying to sneak lunch out of the office candy jar, a little planning goes a long way. Bodybuilders also keep things\n              simple, which leads to consistency. People want variety in their minds, but they tend to prefer simplicity when it comes to real life nutrition\n              plans, according to Roussell.\n              <br/>\n              <br/>\n              <div className=\"rightImage\" >\n              <div>\n              3. Hydration: They drink a lot of water. You should too. For one, liquid calories do not satiate, said Roussell, so it’s easy to\n              get into a caloric surplus with liquid calories. Studies have also shown that drinking water with meals reduces overall calorie\n              intake. And while there's no scientific standard regarding the amount of water you should drink. the general\n              recommendations are nine glasses a day for women and 13 for men. (This also includes the water in drinks like tea and\n              coffee.)\n              </div>\n              <img src = {foodImage3} />\n              </div>\n              <br/>\n              <br/>\n\n              4. Portion sizes: Just like bodybuilders plan, they track. You don’t have to be obsessive, but keep an eye on portion sizes to help you monitor \n              your caloric intake.\n              <br/>\n              <br/>\n\n              5. Food choices: Sticking to lean meat and vegetables as the centerpiece of your meal is a great fat loss strategy. And grilling or broiling them\n              versus frying them will save calories. Basing your intake of grains and starchy vegetables on your activity level will help keep you on track.\n              <br/>\n              <br/>\n\n              So here’s the deal: If you aren’t a bodybuilder, a textbook bodybuilding diet is most likely not for you. Not only is it not practical, but it’s part of\n              a very specific lifestyle. You can’t extract the diet from the lifestyle and expect it to have the same effect. However, there are aspects of a \n              bodybuilder’s diet you can learn from and apply to your own diet if you are looking to shed fat and build muscle.\n              </p>\n          </div>\n          <br/>\n          <div className = \"title\">\n                 Diet and Nutrition for Woman\n          </div>\n          <div className = \"description\">\n            <p>\n            It doesn’t matter how hard you are training in the gym, if you aren’t eating the right foods at the right time, all of your efforts will have been in vain. You can’t out-train a bad diet, which is why we’re going to share a few diet and nutritional secrets with you before leaving.\n            Remember, we’re looking at the ultimate 5-day workout routine for women to get strong and toned, and if you’re not eating right, you will become neither strong, nor toned.\n            Here are some tried and tested methods proven to give great results.\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            1. Drink enough water\n            When it comes to exercise and health in general, adequate hydration is crucial.\n            Water makes up close to 80% of our bodies, and we need it to perform even the most basic of physiological processes. Without adequate amounts of water in our bodies, we run the risk of dehydrating, which can affect athletic performance, and our health in general.\n            When we exercise, we perspire and can lose important electrolytes via our sweat. This is why it’s important to stay well hydrated during exercise, to help replenish the fluids, minerals, and electrolytes we lost through training.\n            Aim for 2.5 litres of mineral water per day. Failing that, filtered water is still very good for you.\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            2. Get plenty of healthy protein\n            Protein is vital for muscle growth and repair. If you want to become strong and/or toned, you need to make sure you are taking enough protein in each day.\n            Aim for around 0.6 – 1 gram of protein per pound of bodyweight, and be sure to spread it out evenly throughout the day. Look for lean and healthy sources like fish, chicken, turkey, eggs, nuts, seeds, dairy, and grass-fed red meat.\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            3. Invest in a good quality whey protein\n            Providing you can consume whey, whey protein is a supplement you will need to invest in if you wish to build muscle and burn fat.\n            Whey protein shakes are perfect because one shake provides around 30 or more grams of protein per serving. They’re easy to make, convenient, they taste great, and they’re full of other nutrients that the muscles thrive upon.\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            4. Don’t forget your veggies\n            As well as protein, healthy fats, and complex carbs, you will also need to make sure you are eating plenty of vegetables.\n            Vegetables are full of digestive-friendly dietary fiber, they’re rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, and they help to give your meals extra texture and flavour.\n            Don’t rely on vitamin supplements alone when it comes to nutrient intakes, instead, make sure you eat plenty of fresh vegetables each day.\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n\n            </p>\n          </div>      \n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\n\nexport default List;\n","import Menu from './Menu';\n\nexport default Menu;","import React from 'react';\nimport { Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';\n\n// Import scenes\nimport List from './scenes/List';\nclass Menu extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    const { path } = this.props.match;\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <Switch>\n          <Route path={`${path}/`} render={props => <List {...props} />} />\n        </Switch>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Menu;\n","import List from './List';\n\nexport default List;","import React from 'react';\nimport { Row, Col } from 'reactstrap';\nimport suppImage1 from 'assets/images/supplements/10.png';\nimport foodImage2 from 'assets/images/foods/11.png';\nimport foodImage3 from 'assets/images/foods/12.png';\nimport './List.css';\nclass List extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n  }\n  render() {\n\n\n    return (\n      <div className = \"food\">\n          <div className = \"title\">\n          The 3 Best Supplements to Gain Muscle\n          </div>\n          <div className = \"description\">\n              <p>\n              If you exercise regularly, you likely want to be sure you’re getting the most out of it.One important benefit of exercise is gaining muscle and \n              strength. Having a healthy amount of muscle allows to you to perform your best during exercise and daily life.\n              <br/>\n              <br/>\n              Three main criteria must be met for maximal muscle gain: eating more calories than you \n              burn, consuming more protein than you break down and an exercise program that is challenging \n              to your muscles (1Trusted Source, 2Trusted Source, 3Trusted Source).\n              <br/>\n              <br/>\n              While it’s possible to meet all these criteria without taking dietary supplements, certain supplements may help you meet your goals.\n              <br/>\n              <br/>\n              The 3 supplements listed below may help you gain more muscle with your exercise program.\n              <br/>\n              <br/>\n\n              <div className = \"rightImage\">\n              <div>\n              1. Creatine\n              Creatine is a molecule that’s produced naturally in your body. It provides energy for your muscles and \n              other tissues.However, taking it as a dietary supplement can increase muscle creatine content by up to\n              40% beyondits normal levels (4Trusted Source, 5Trusted Source, 6Trusted Source).This affects your \n              muscle cells and exercise performance, promoting muscle gain. In fact, a large amount of research shows\n              creatine improves muscle strength (7Trusted Source, 8Trusted Source, 9Trusted Source).This is good news\n              if you’re trying to gain muscle. Greater strength allows you to perform better during exercise, leading to\n              larger increases in muscle mass over time (10Trusted Source).\n              <br/>\n              </div>\n              <img src = {suppImage1} />\n              </div>\n              Creatine can also increase water content in your muscle cells. This may cause your muscle cells to swell slightly and produce signals for\n              muscle growth (11Trusted Source).\n              Furthermore, this supplement may increase levels of the hormones involved in muscle growth, such as IGF-1 (12Trusted Source).Moreover,\n              some research shows that creatine could decrease the breakdown of proteins in your muscles (13Trusted Source).Overall, many researchers \n              have studied creatine supplements and exercise, and one thing is clear — creatine can help increase muscle mass (14Trusted Source, \n              15Trusted Source).\n              <br/>\n              <br/>\n              Creatine has also been studied extensively and has an outstanding safety profile (14Trusted Source). If you are looking for a supplement to\n              help you gain muscle, consider creatine first.\n              <br/>\n              <br/>\n              Shop for creatine supplements online.\n              <br/>\n              <br/>\n              2. Protein Supplements\n              Getting enough protein is critical for gaining muscle.\n              <br/>\n              <br/>\n              Specifically, to gain muscle, you need to consume more protein than your body breaks down through natural processes (16Trusted Source).\n              <br/>\n              <br/>\n              While it’s possible to get all the protein you need from protein-rich foods, some people struggle to do so. If this sounds like you, you may \n              want to consider \n              taking a protein supplement.\n              <br/>\n              <br/>\n              There are many different protein supplements available, but some of the most popular are whey, casein and soy protein. Other protein \n              supplements\n              contain protein isolated from eggs, beef, chicken or other sources (17Trusted Source). Research shows that adding extra protein via \n              supplements causes \n              slightly more muscle gain in people who exercise than adding extra carbs (18Trusted\n              Source, 19Trusted Source, 20Trusted Source). However, the effects are probably largest for people who aren’t getting enough protein in their\n              normal diet.\n              In fact, some research shows that consuming very high amounts of protein supplements doesn’t help increase muscle if you are already \n              following a \n              high-protein diet (21Trusted Source, 22Trusted Source, 23Trusted Source, 24Trusted Source).\n              Many people wonder how much protein to eat daily. If you are an active individual trying to gain muscle, 0.5–0.9 grams of protein per pound \n              (1.2–2.0 grams \n              per kg) of body weight may be best (25Trusted Source, 26Trusted Source, 27Trusted Source).\n              <br/>\n              <br/>\n              Shop for protein supplements online.\n              <br/>\n              <br/>\n              3. Weight Gainers\n              Weight gainers are supplements designed to conveniently help you get more calories and protein. They’re typically used by individuals who\n              struggle to gain muscle.\n              <br/>\n              <br/>\n              Some people find it hard to gain muscle, even when consuming large amounts of calories and lifting weights (28Trusted Source). Although \n              the calorie contents of weight gainer supplements vary, it’s not uncommon for them to contain over 1,000 calories per serving.Many people \n              think these calories come from protein since it’s so important for muscle building. However, most of the calories actually come from carbs.\n              There are often 75–300 grams of carbs and 20–60 grams of protein per serving of these high-calorie supplements.While these products can\n              help you consume more calories, it’s important to realize that there is nothing magical about weight gainer supplements. Some research in \n              physically inactive adults has shown that drastically increasing calories can increase lean mass like muscle, as long as you eat enough \n              protein (29Trusted Source). However, research in adults who weight trained indicated that consuming a weight gainer supplement may not \n              be effective for increasing lean mass (28Trusted Source).\n              <br/>\n              <br/>\n              Overall, weight gainers are only recommended if you are struggling to eat enough food and you find it easier to drink a weight gainer shake than eat \n              more real food.\n              <br/>\n              <br/>\n              Shop for weight gainer supplements online.\n              <br/>\n              <br/>\n              SUMMARY:\n              Weight gainers are high-calorie products designed to help you consume more calories and protein. However, they are only recommended if you struggle\n              to get enough calories from food.\n              <br/>\n              <br/>\n            </p>\n          </div>      \n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\n\nexport default List;\n","import Restaurants from './Restaurants';\n\nexport default Restaurants;","import React from 'react';\nimport { Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';\n\n// Import scenes\nimport List from './scenes/List';\n\nclass Restaurants extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    const { path } = this.props.match;\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <Switch>\n          <Route path={`${path}/`} render={props => <List {...props} />} />\n        </Switch>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Restaurants;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport { Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';\n\n/** Import components */\nimport TopNav from './components/TopNav/TopNav';\nimport Sidebar from './components/Sidebar/Sidebar';\n\n/** Import scenes */\nimport Landing from './scenes/Home';\nimport Exercise from './scenes/Exercise';\nimport Food from './scenes/Food';\nimport Supplements from './scenes/Supplements';\nimport backgroundImg  from 'assets/images/background.png';\n/** Import assets */\nimport './home.css';\n\nclass Home extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n\n    // if (this.props.location.pathname === '/') {\n    //   window.location.href = '/home';\n    // }\n\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <img src = {backgroundImg} className = \"background\"/>\n        <div id=\"home\" className=\"home-container\">\n            \n            <div className=\"container-fluid scenes-container\">\n              <div className = \"sidebar-container\">\n                  <Sidebar/>\n              </div>\n              <div className = \"main-container\">\n                <TopNav/>\n                <Switch>\n                  <Route path=\"/\"           exact render={props => <Landing     {...props} />}  />\n                  <Route path=\"/home\"        render={props => <Landing     {...props} />}  />\n                  <Route path=\"/exercise\"    render={props => <Exercise    {...props} />} />\n                  <Route path=\"/food\"        render={props => <Food        {...props} />} />\n                  <Route path=\"/supplements\" render={props => <Supplements {...props} />} />\n                </Switch>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n      </div>\n     \n    );\n  }\n}\nexport default Home;","import React from 'react';\nimport {\n  BrowserRouter as Router,\n  Route,\n  Switch,\n  Redirect\n} from 'react-router-dom';\n// import AOS from 'aos';\n\n// Import scenes\nimport Home from './scenes/Home/Home';\n\n// Import modals\n\n/** Import redux actions */\n\nclass App extends React.Component {\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <main>\n        <Router>\n          <Switch>\n            <Route path=\"/\" render={props => <Home {...props} />} />\n            <Redirect to=\"/404\" />\n          </Switch>\n        </Router>\n      </main>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport { render } from 'react-dom';\nimport { Provider } from 'react-redux';\nimport { ConnectedRouter } from 'react-router-redux';\nimport store, { history } from './store';\n\nimport App from './App';\nimport './assets/fonts/font-awesome/scss/font-awesome.css';\nimport 'assets/scss/restaurant_admin.css';\nimport 'global.css';\n\n\nconst target = document.querySelector('#root');\nconsole.log(history);\nrender(\n  <Provider store={store}>\n      {/* <ConnectedRouter history={history}> */}\n          <App />\n    {/* </ConnectedRouter> */}\n  </Provider>,\n  target\n);","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/11.bd39cd7a.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/12.97e171a4.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/logo.534891d9.jpg\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/1.bd31f5c5.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/1.5ae21dfd.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/2.1ef0cf2f.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/3.89a613b0.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/5.a86ee19f.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/6.fde24b0b.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/10.babac6d2.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/10.5cbe3c34.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/background.fde24b0b.png\";"],"sourceRoot":""}
