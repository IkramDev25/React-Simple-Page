They’re typically used by individuals who\n              struggle to gain muscle.\n              <br/>\n              <br/>\n              Some people find it hard to gain muscle, even when consuming large amounts of calories and lifting weights (28Trusted Source). Although \n              the calorie contents of weight gainer supplements vary, it’s not uncommon for them to contain over 1,000 calories per serving.Many people \n              think these calories come from protein since it’s so important for muscle building. However, most of the calories actually come from carbs.\n              There are often 75–300 grams of carbs and 20–60 grams of protein per serving of these high-calorie supplements.While these products can\n              help you consume more calories, it’s important to realize that there is nothing magical about weight gainer supplements. Some research in \n              physically inactive adults has shown that drastically increasing calories can increase lean mass like muscle, as long as you eat enough \n              protein (29Trusted Source). However, research in adults who weight trained indicated that consuming a weight gainer supplement may not \n              be effective for increasing lean mass (28Trusted Source).\n              <br/>\n              <br/>\n              Overall, weight gainers are only recommended if you are struggling to eat enough food and you find it easier to drink a weight gainer shake than eat \n              more real food.\n              <br/>\n              <br/>\n              Shop for weight gainer supplements online.\n              <br/>\n              <br/>\n              SUMMARY:\n              Weight gainers are high-calorie products designed to help you consume more calories and protein. However, they are only recommended if you struggle\n              to get enough calories from food.\n              <br/>\n              <br/>\n            </p>\n          </div>      \n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\n\nexport default List;\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
