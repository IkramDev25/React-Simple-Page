Well, there are a few things. 1. Calories: Most fitness enthusiasts\\u2014even the one who are really into it\\u2014don't spend hours at the gym training a body part. They have limited time to work out, and as a result, they simply aren't expending the same amount of energy as a bodybuilder. Six meals a day can add up quickly. If you aren't perfectly portioning out every meal, you could easily go over your maintenance or fat-loss totals and find yourself in a surplus.\"), \"2. Meal frequency: Somewhere along the line it became established that eating frequently (as in every two hours or so) would rev up your metabolism, like stoking a fire. But scientific evidence doesn't necessarily support this. \\u201CMeal frequency does not boost metabolism, \\u201DRoussell said. In fact, too much protein intake can cause your body to build up a tolerance. That means  you won't effectively utilize dietary protein as opposed to if you spaced out your meals more. Roussell suggests waiting at least two hours to eat after a liquid protein, like BCAAs or a shake, or four hours after a solid meal. 3. Carbohydrates: No, they aren't the devil, but if you want to get shredded, intake needs to be monitored. Again, these massive dudes are using up a ton of energy, and their  carbohydrate intake requirements will be higher than the average lifter. Roussell suggests  keeping your starchiest carbs contained to your post-workout meal or in the morning. And if you aren\\u2019t satisfied with the results, eliminate the starchy carbs from breakfast. 4. Longevity: Do you want to eat chicken breasts and broccoli forever? Even bodybuilders cycle their diet, eating more calories during the off season to pack on muscle, and then changing their diet to shed pounds of body fat for competitions. It's a tough lifestyle that  requires a lot of commitment, and most of us are more interested in staying reasonably lean year round instead of swinging between gaining and losing weight. Plain and simple, bodybuilders ultimately have different goals, and their lives revolve around getting up on  stage at sub-10 percent body fat. But there definitely are takeaways from a bodybuilding diet that can help the average person build muscle and burn excess body fat. 1. Protein: Most of us don\\u2019t eat enough of it. But if you want to feel satisfied after a meal and have the proper nutrients to build muscle, you want to consume at least 30g per meal. This number will trigger your body\\u2019s ability to optimally synthesize protein, and is the minimum amount needed to for a satiety response. In other words, you are more likely to be satisfied eating four meals with 30g minimum of protein, than 6 to 8 meals with less protein. 2. Planning: Bodybuilders plan out their meals, leaving nothing to chance. Whether it be meal prep for the week, or keeping protein powder at t he office so you aren\\u2019t stuck trying to sneak lunch out of the office candy jar, a little planning goes a long way. Bodybuilders also keep things simple, which leads to consistency. People want variety in their minds, but they tend to prefer simplicity when it comes to real life nutrition plans, according to Roussell. 3. Hydration: They drink a lot of water. You should too. For one, liquid calories do not satiate, said Roussell, so it\\u2019s easy to get into a caloric surplus with liquid calories. Studies have also shown that drinking water with meals reduces overall calorie intake. And while there's no scientific standard regarding the amount of water you should drink. the general recommendations are nine glasses a day for women and 13 for men. (This also includes the water in drinks like tea and coffee.) 4. Portion sizes: Just like bodybuilders plan, they track. You don\\u2019t have to be obsessive, but keep an eye on portion sizes to help you monitor your caloric intake. 5. Food choices: Sticking to lean meat and vegetables as the centerpiece of your meal is a great fat loss strategy. And grilling or broiling them versus frying them will save calories. Basing your intake of grains and starchy vegetables on your activity level will help keep you on track. So here\\u2019s the deal: If you aren\\u2019t a bodybuilder, a textbook bodybuilding diet is most likely not for you. Not only is it not practical, but it\\u2019s part of a very specific lifestyle. You can\\u2019t extract the diet from the lifestyle and expect it to have the same effect. However, there are aspects of a bodybuilder\\u2019s diet you can learn from and apply to your own diet if you are looking to shed fat and build muscle.\")));\n  }\n\n}\n\nexport default List;","map":{"version":3,"sources":["E:\\MyProjets\\bodybuilding\\app1\\src\\scenes\\Home\\scenes\\Food\\scenes\\List\\List.js"],"names":["React","Row","Col","foodImage1","foodImage2","foodImage3","List","Component","constructor","props","render"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAP,MAAkB,OAAlB;AACA,SAASC,GAAT,EAAcC,GAAd,QAAyB,YAAzB;AACA,OAAOC,UAAP,MAAuB,4BAAvB;AACA,OAAOC,UAAP,MAAuB,4BAAvB;AACA,OAAOC,UAAP,MAAuB,4BAAvB;AACA,OAAO,YAAP;;AACA,MAAMC,IAAN,SAAmBN,KAAK,CAACO,SAAzB,CAAmC;AACjCC,EAAAA,WAAW,CAACC,KAAD,EAAQ;AACjB,UAAMA,KAAN;AACD;;AACDC,EAAAA,MAAM,GAAG;AAGP,WACE;AAAK,MAAA,SAAS,EAAG,MAAjB;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,OACI;AAAK,MAAA,SAAS,EAAG,OAAjB;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,qEADJ,EAII;AAAK,MAAA,SAAS,EAAG,aAAjB;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,OACI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,OACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,2mBADA,ugIADJ,CAJJ,CADF;AAkED;;AAzEgC;;AA6EnC,eAAeJ,IAAf","sourcesContent":["import React from 'react';\nimport { Row, Col } from 'reactstrap';\nimport foodImage1 from 'assets/images/foods/10.png';\nimport foodImage2 from 'assets/images/foods/11.png';\nimport foodImage3 from 'assets/images/foods/12.png';\nimport './List.css';\nclass List extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n  }\n  render() {\n\n\n    return (\n      <div className = \"food\">\n          <div className = \"title\">\n                 How Eating Like a Professional Bodybuilder Can Make You Fat\n          </div>\n          <div className = \"description\">\n              <p>\n              <div>Now that that's out of the way, what about that style of eating could cause an average\n              gym goer to get a little thicker around the middle?
